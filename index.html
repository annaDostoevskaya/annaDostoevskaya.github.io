        <p>
            I'm having a read through gingerBill's memory allocation articles (thanks, btw).
            Wondering why <tt>DEFAULT_ALIGNMENT</tt> was defined as <tt>2*sizeof(void *)</tt>.
            Would that not be double the architecture word size, where the word size alone would be the largest alignment required?
            (Rather than ping him, figured I could just leave this as an open question, in case I'm missing something obvious.)
